# Computer Science Notes - Aidan Butler

### This is a centralized repository for all of my computer science related notes.
### Split up into 4 main sub-sections: 
### AI, Cloud, Cyber Security, & Software Development.
### I aim to research all of these topics to a relatively advanced degree, and complete detailed notes on each.
